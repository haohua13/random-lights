# random-lights
Random art for projector nights. Uses random sinusoidal functions for image generation. Change (X/Y) values, time-offsets, RGB values for different images. 
[In Progress]

Run test.py
This is the initial version that only uses sin/cos mathematical functions

Example image:

<img src = "https://github.com/haohua13/random-lights/blob/main/img0.png" title = "Image" width = 500 >

Run trippy_image_generator.py
Since each RGB channel is generated from a different expression, with time-offset and different mathematical operations the images are rendered in a "flowy" manner, creating a trippy effect! 

Example:

<img src = "https://github.com/haohua13/random-lights/blob/main/symmetric_trippy_frame.png" title = "Image" width = 500 >


Run nature_image_generator.py
[In Progress]
Added more toned down colors and symmetry for nature (water, clouds, tress, etc) images
