# random-lights
Random art for projector nights. Uses random sinusoidal functions for image generation. Basically changes (X/Y) values, time-offsets in each function, RGB values to generate different images.

[In Progress]

Run test.py

This is the initial version that only uses sin/cos mathematical functions

Example image:

<img src = "https://github.com/haohua13/random-lights/blob/main/img0.png" title = "Image" width = 500 >

Run trippy_image_generator.py

Since each RGB channel is generated from a different expression, with time-offset and different mathematical operations, the images are rendered in a "flowy" manner, creating a trippy effect! 

Example:

<img src = "https://github.com/haohua13/random-lights/blob/main/symmetric_trippy_frame.png" title = "Image" width = 500 >


Run nature_image_generator.py

Added more toned down colors and symmetry for nature (water, clouds, tress, etc) images. Instead using different expressions, we use the same expressions for the RGB channels, but change only the time-offset
